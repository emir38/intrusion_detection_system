An Intrusion Detection System written in Python.

Satellite is currently a monitor to detect man-in-the-middle attacks, DoS, brute force (SSH - HTTP), possible Command and Control, and also network port scans.
This tool is used mainly for educational purposes in the practitioner's local network, in order to obtain knowledge of how these attacks work behind the scenes and learn how to filter for them.

To use it, variables must be adjusted, such as known_c2_domains, know_c2_ips, whitelist, etc. This must be done according to each person's network. The script indicates which data must be modified.

To learn!
